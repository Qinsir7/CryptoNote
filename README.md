# CryptoNote

Simple notes can do everything. Write once. Execute everywhere.
Just make daily notes without intentional prompts.

## Overview
NoteAgent represents the convergence of familiar interfaces and powerful Web3 functionality. We're not asking users to learn new platforms or workflows - we're bringing blockchain superpowers to the tools they already use every day. User can interact with blockchain just when record notes while daily thinking.
We're creating an AI co-pilot for the entire Web3 ecosystem, accessible through the simplest interface possible - the notes app already on your Mac. This represents new paradigm of interaction with blockchain: no new interface, no new workflow.

## Current Problem
1. Cumbersome and complex UX
2. Segregated process, step away from daily workflow
3. Security concerns, no one wants to expose their assets to unknown platforms
