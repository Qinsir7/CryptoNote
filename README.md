# CryptoNote

## Slogan
Simple notes can do everything
Write once. Execute everywhere.
Just make daily notes instead of intentional prompts

## Background
NoteAgent represents the convergence of familiar interfaces and powerful Web3 functionality. We're not asking users to learn new platforms or workflows - we're bringing blockchain superpowers to the tools they already use every day.
We're creating an AI co-pilot for the entire Web3 ecosystem, accessible through the simplest interface possible - the notes app already on your Mac.
